# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Problem Statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution Overview
The solution to this problem involves generating Fibonacci numbers and checking if they are even. If they are, we add them to a cumulative sum until we reach the limit of four million.

## Implementation Details
- The Fibonacci sequence starts with 1 and 2.
- We will iterate through the sequence, checking each term to see if it is even.
- The sum of all even Fibonacci numbers will be calculated and returned.

## Usage
To run the solution, execute the `solution.py` file in a Python environment. Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine.

## Example
For example, the even Fibonacci numbers less than four million are:
```
2, 8, 34
```
Their sum is:
```
2 + 8 + 34 = 44
```

## Notes
- This problem is a great exercise in understanding both recursion and iteration.
- Consider optimizing the solution to avoid unnecessary calculations, especially for larger limits.
