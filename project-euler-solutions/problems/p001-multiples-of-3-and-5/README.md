# Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5

## Problem Statement

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Solution Overview

The solution to this problem involves iterating through all natural numbers below 1000 and checking if each number is a multiple of 3 or 5. If it is, we add it to a cumulative sum. 

### Key Points

- The problem can be solved using a simple loop and conditional statements.
- The efficiency of the solution is adequate given the constraints (numbers below 1000).
- This problem serves as a good introduction to basic programming concepts such as loops and conditionals.

## Implementation

The solution can be found in the `solution.py` file located in this directory. The implementation is straightforward and demonstrates the fundamental approach to solving problems in Project Euler.

## Notes

- This problem is often used as a warm-up exercise for those new to programming or Project Euler.
- Understanding how to manipulate and check conditions on numbers is crucial for more complex problems in the future.
