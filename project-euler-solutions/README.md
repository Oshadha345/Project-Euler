## üéâ Introduction

> "Nothing takes place in the world whose meaning is not that of some maximum or minimum."  
> ‚Äî *Leonhard Euler*

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve.  
This repository contains solutions to various problems, implemented in **Python** üêç.  
The goal is to provide clear and efficient solutions while also enhancing programming skills.

## üìù Problem Solutions

The solutions to the problems are organized in the [`problems`](./problems) directory.  
Each problem has its own subdirectory containing the solution and a README file that provides an overview of the problem statement and any relevant notes.

| #  | Problem | Directory | Description |
|----|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 1  | **Multiples of 3 and 5** | [`problems/p001-multiples-of-3-and-5`](problems/p001-multiples-of-3-and-5) | Calculates the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. |
| 2  | **Even Fibonacci Numbers** | [`problems/p002-even-fibonacci-numbers`](problems/p002-even-fibonacci-numbers) | Finds the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed four million. |
| 3  | **Largest Prime Factor** | [`problems/p003-largest-prime-factor`](problems/p003-largest-prime-factor) | Determines the largest prime factor of a given number. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Utilities

The [`utils`](./utils) directory contains helper functions that can be reused across different problem solutions:

- **`math_helpers.py`**: Utility functions related to mathematical operations.
- **`test_helpers.py`**: Helper functions for testing the solutions to ensure they produce the expected results.
