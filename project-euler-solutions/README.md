## Introduction

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. This repository contains solutions to various problems, implemented in Python. The goal is to provide clear and efficient solutions while also enhancing programming skills.

## Problem Solutions

The solutions to the problems are organized in the `problems` directory. Each problem has its own subdirectory containing the solution and a README file that provides an overview of the problem statement and any relevant notes.

- **Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5**
  - Directory: `problems/p001-multiples-of-3-and-5`
  - Description: Calculates the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

- **Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers**
  - Directory: `problems/p002-even-fibonacci-numbers`
  - Description: Finds the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed four million.

- **Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor**
  - Directory: `problems/p003-largest-prime-factor`
  - Description: Determines the largest prime factor of a given number.

## Utilities

The `utils` directory contains helper functions that can be reused across different problem solutions:

- **math_helpers.py**: Utility functions related to mathematical operations.
- **test_helpers.py**: Helper functions for testing the solutions to ensure they produce the expected results.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a solution to a Project Euler problem or improvements to existing solutions, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
